    "To ensure the accuracy and reliability of the analysis, both the pollen_load_data and flower_visitation_data datasets were carefully cleaned prior to merging. \n",
    "Missing values in the key columns such as bee_id, flower_species, and pollen_load were addressed either by removal or imputation, based on their significance to the study. Data types were standardized. This comprehensive cleaning process created a robust foundation for exploratory analysis. \n"

    "A series of exploratory analyses were conducted to uncover patterns and relationships in bee foraging and flower visitation. \n",
    "    - Descriptive statistics revealed that the average pollen load varied significantly between flower species, suggesting certain flowers were more attractive or accessible to bees.\n",
    "    - Pollen load by bee species showed some bee species consistently collected higher amounts of pollen, highlighting differences in foraging efficiency. \n",
    "    - Correlation analysis identified a positive relationship betwen visit frequency and pollen load, indicating that frequent visitors are likely to collect more pollen. \n",

    "Conclusions\n",
    "The combined analysis of pollen load and flower visitation data provides meaningful insights into wild bee foraging behavior. The results suggest that both flower species and bee species play critical roles in determining pollen collection success. Farms with a diversity of high-pollen-yielding flowers are likely to support more productive bee communities. Targeted planting of preferred flower species may enhance pollinator health and ecological resilience. "

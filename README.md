# Bee Pollen Data Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes flower abundance and diversity data along with bee abundance, diversity, and activity data collected during extensive surveys carried out on farms in Hampshire and West Sussex, southern England between 2013 and 2015.

## Dataset Description

The pollen diets of wild solitary bees were quantified using:
- Direct observations
- Pollen load analysis

## Purpose

## Funding

This work was funded by:
- Natural Environment Research Council grant NE/J016802/1
- Game and Wildlife Conservation Trust

## Data Files

- `2015_pollen_load_data.csv` - Pollen load analysis data
- `2013_2015_flower_visitation_data.csv` - Flower visitation observations

## Analysis

The analysis is conducted in `bee_pollen.ipynb` and includes:
